You will need this later to put in your portfolio) The data for this exercise was kindly supplied by J. Louter (INT/ILC) and was derived from an experiment in which adult C.elegans nematodes were exposed to varying concentrations of different compounds. The variables RawData (the outcome - number of offspring counted as an integer value, after incubation time), compName (the generic name of the compound/chemical), the compConcentration (the concentration of the compound), and the expType are the most important variables in this dataset. A typical analysis with this data would be to run a dose-response analysis using a log-logistic model with estimates for the maximal, the minimal, the IC50 concentration and the slope at IC50. We will not go into the details but a good package to run such computations and create graphs in R is the {drc} package. See: and:. In the exercise below we will create some visualizations using {ggplot2}. A. Review the following Excel file in the ./data/CE.LIQ.FLOW.062_Tidydata.xlsx (its here), by opening the file in Excel. See if you can spot anything peculiar about this file. Do not edit the file in any way. Just close it when you are done. (Annoyingly, Excel asks you to save your changes, even if you did not touch anything in the file: why is this cumbersome?) B. Open the file in R, using the {readxl} package. C. Inspect the data types of columns RawData, compName and compConcentration. What types would you expect from the experimental description above. Have the data types been correctly assigned during the importing of the data into R? D. Create a graph displaying a scatterplot for the CE.LIQ.FLOW.062_Tidydata.xlsx data, for the different compounds and the varying concentrations. Put the compConcentration on the x-axis, the DataRaw counts on the y-axis and assign a colour to each level in compName. Assign a different symbol (shape =) to each level in the expType variable. Try fixing the labels of the x-axis so that we can read them. E. When creating the plot under C), what happened with the ordering of the x-axis labels. Explain why this happens. Look at the data-type of the compConcentration column in the data again to find a clue. F. Correct the data-type of compConcentration to numeric and than look at the graph again. Use a log10 transformation on the x-axis to get a clear graph. Also, add a bit of jitter to the points in the graph so that points are not overlapping. G &amp; H. Fill in: (G) The positive control for this experiments is .. (H) The negative control for this experiment is .. I. Think about how you would analyze this experiment to learn whether there is indeed an effect of different concentrations on offspring count and whether the different compounds have a different curve (IC50). Write down you analysis as a step-wise plan. J. Normalize the data for the controlNegative in such a way that the mean value for controlNegative is exactly equal to 1 and that all other values are expressed as a fraction thereof. Rerun your graphs with the normalized data. K. Why would you want to take the step under J? A Q: Review the following Excel file in the ./data/CE.LIQ.FLOW.062_Tidydata.xlsx (its here), by opening the file in Excel. See if you can spot anything peculiar about this file. Do not edit the file in any way. Just close it when you are done. (Annoyingly, Excel asks you to save your changes, even if you did not touch anything in the file: why is this cumbersome?) A: Someone put a lot of care into the make-up of the sheet and its still difficult to read.

What types would you expect from the experimental description above. Have the data types been correctly assigned during the importing of the data into R? A: You would expect compConcentration to be dbl but its in chr so it was imported incorrectly. D Create a graph displaying a scatterplot for the CE.LIQ.FLOW.062_Tidydata.xlsx data, for the different compounds and the varying concentrations. Put the compConcentration on the x-axis, the DataRaw counts on the y-axis and assign a colour to each level in compName. Assign a different symbol (shape =) to each level in the expType variable.

We use the criteria for reproduciblity that are publically available via here (#tab:read criteria table)Reproducibility criteria Transparency Criteria Definition Response Type Study Purpose A concise statement in the introduction of the article, often in the last paragraph, that establishes the reason the research was conducted. Also called the study objective. Binary Data Availability Statement A statement, in an individual section offset from the main body of text, that explains how or if one can access a studys data. The title of the section may vary, but it must explicitly mention data; it is therefore distinct from a supplementary materials section. Binary Data Location Where the articles data can be accessed, either raw or processed. Found Value Study Location Author has stated in the methods section where the study took place or the datas country/region of origin. Binary; Found Value Author Review The professionalism of the contact information that the author has provided in the manuscript. Found Value Ethics Statement A statement within the manuscript indicating any ethical concerns, including the presence of sensitive data. Binary Funding Statement A statement within the manuscript indicating whether or not the authors received funding for their research. Binary Code Availability Authors have shared access to the most updated code that they used in their study, including code used for analysis. Binary Table clarification The Transparency Criteria are criteria you need to score the article of your choice for. Read them carefully and discuss with another course participant if you do not understand them. Each Tranparance criterion comes with a Definition that explains the criterion in more details. These descriptions are particularly helpful to understand what the criterium entails and what to look for in the article. The Response Type is the actual score In this assisgment you need to find a scientific article yourself, using PubMed or another database or repository. Use only Open Access articles. Having an article in hand, go over the table above and score the article according the criteria. Be sure to select a primary article that presents a study using data from experimental work . This can be laboratory experiments or in silico experiments. Reviews and meta analysis are not suitable for this assignment To guide your search you can choose between these topics Coronavirus / COVID-19 The effects of compound on an organism / Toxicology The effectiveness of a drug or treatment in an animal study The effects of a compound investigated in a cell or organoid system TIPS If you do not know where to start your literature search start here: https://www.biorxiv.org/ This assignment is not about the topic you select, so try to do that quickly You may want to cheat and select an article that scores TRUE on the Data Availability Statement, because that enables you to use the this article again in one of the next assignments.

To do this patient material such as saliva and nose/throat swabs were used with four types of RATs and the standard PCR test. The RATs were also tested using 2 isolated virus strands. The RATs were less sensitive than the PCR test. Some of the RATs are not able to detect low quantities of virusparticles. There is no big difference between the isolated virus and the clinical samples.
